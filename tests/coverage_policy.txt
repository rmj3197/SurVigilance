Coverage Policy for using # pragma: no cover and other details

- We do not test the VAERS portion of the app, since it is protected by a GUI captcha that cannot be handled through an API-based approach in pytest.
- We intentionally avoid monkeypatching/mocking remote websites in tests. Mocked tests can pass even if the real site changes, hiding inconsistencies.
- For scraping and UI flows that rely on a live website or real browser behavior, we prefer tests to fail when the website changes so we know to update our logic.
- Therefore, we exclude specific lines of code from coverage where executing them meaningfully requires live sites/GUI. 
- Additionally, for scenarios where button for switching streamlit pages are present, we use # pragma: no cover, as streamlit testing (AppTest) only supports testing a single page of an app per instance. For multipage apps, each page will need to be tested separately. 
  AppTest is not yet compatible with multipage apps using st.navigation and st.Page. For details please see https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/app-testing/st.testing.v1.apptest.
