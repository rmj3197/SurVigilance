===========================

Improvements
------------

*   **Scrapers:** Introduced a new `num_retries` parameter across all scraper functions (e.g., `scrape_daen_sb`, `scrape_dma_sb`) to enhance robustness against temporary network issues.
*   **Connectivity:** Added a new utility function, `check_site_connectivity`, to verify the accessibility of target websites before initiating scraping operations.
*   **Documentation:** Updated the project documentation to include daily status reports for `SurVigilance` operations, providing better monitoring.
*   **User Interface (GUI):** The graphical user interface has been enhanced to allow users to input the `num_retries` parameter directly, offering greater control over scraping attempts.
